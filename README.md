# XOR Encryption/Decryption Program in C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates XOR-based encryption and decryption. The program allows a user to input a password, encrypts it using an XOR cipher with a fixed key, and then decrypts it back to the original password.

## Features
- **XOR Encryption/Decryption**: The program uses a basic XOR cipher to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
- **Password Validation**: The program checks that the entered password is at least 8 characters long before proceeding with encryption.
- **Hexadecimal Output**: The encrypted password is printed in hexadecimal format for easier inspection.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input a password that must be at least 8 characters long.
2. It encrypts the password using XOR with a fixed key (`"ThisIsAComplexKey!123"`).
3. The encrypted password is displayed in hexadecimal format.
4. The program then decrypts the password by applying XOR again with the same key.
5. Finally, the original password is printed after decryption.

## Program Flow

- **Encryption**: The password is XOR'd with a key, and each character of the input is transformed.
- **Decryption**: Since XOR is a reversible operation, the same key is used to decrypt the password, returning it to its original form.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xor-encryption.git
   cd xor-encryption
Compile the program using gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) or your preferred C compiler:

bash
Copy
gcc xor_encryption.c -o xor_encryption
Run the program:

bash
Copy
./xor_encryption
The program will prompt you to enter a password. Make sure the password is at least 8 characters long.

Example
Here's an example of how the program behaves:

text
Copy
Enter a password (8 or more characters): myPassword123
Encrypted password (in hexadecimal): 0D1C1A1F171A110D
Decrypted password: myPassword123
Requirements
A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Standard C library (for functions like malloc, fgets, strlen, etc.)
Security Disclaimer
This program uses the XOR cipher for educational purposes. XOR encryption is not secure and should not be used in real-world applications to protect sensitive data. For production use, consider using more secure encryption algorithms like AES or RSA.
